Tidy data and joins!
--------------------

For this assignment, I will work with the Gapminder dataset again.

### Data Reshaping Prompt

In this prompt I have chosen Activity \#2:

-   Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries. Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.
-   Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

### Join Prompt (join, merge, look up)

In this prompt I have chosen Activity \#1:

-   Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:
-   One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capitol city.
-   One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern hemisphere.
